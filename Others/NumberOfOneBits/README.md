### Number of 1 Bits
[**Solution**](https://github.com/kumaranil3921/LeetCode-Top-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Others/NumberOfOneBits/NumberOfOneBits.js)   

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
```

**Example 2:**  

```
Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
```  

**Example 3:**  

```
Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
```  

**Constraints:**
* 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
