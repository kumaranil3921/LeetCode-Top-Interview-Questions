[**Solution**](https://github.com/kumaranil3921/LeetCode-Top-Interview-Questions/blob/main/String/ReverseString/ReverseString.js)  

You must do this by modifying the input array ```in-place``` with ```O(1)``` extra memory.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**
* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s[i] is a printable ascii character.
